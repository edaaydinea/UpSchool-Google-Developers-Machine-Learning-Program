### How did I get the right to participate in the training?

- I registered on the dates when the application processes were received. On June 9, 2022, I learned by e-mail that I had successfully passed the online form stage.
 ![](Stage_Pictures/01_online_form_result.png)
- Then I took a 40-minute online English test and an 80-minute technical test. The technical test included Python programming and Machine Learning. On July 1, 2022, I learned by this email that I am eligible for interviews.
  ![](Stage_Pictures/02_technical_test_result.png)
- Then, in the interview (on July 6, 2022), there were 2 different participants besides me and 2 people working within the Up School. In the conversational interview, we talked about our purpose of participation in the program and our future goals.
- On July 8, 2022, I learned by e-mail that I was accepted to the Up School Machine Learning program.
